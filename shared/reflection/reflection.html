<p>
    I was an intern at <a href="http://www.lustlab.net/" target="_blank">LustLab</a> between the 1st of July and 13th of November, 2015.
    I first found out about the studio during the first year of my studies, when our teacher <a
        href="http://openwork.net/" target="_blank">Susana Carvalho</a> presented some of their projects in one of her
    lessons. The project we were doing at the time with Susana was about the topic of systems: how we as designers could
    take a different position towards the artifacts we produce; instead of configuring specific content within a
    physically limited object or graphic container, we can design systems - a set of interrelated rules - that would in
    turn design both the content and its form.
</p>

<p>
    The encounter with the work of Lust and LustLab and with systemic thinking has set me on a path that I am still on
    today. After the completion of Susana's assignment, I made the decision to subordinate all my academic projects to
    the goal of becoming a designer of systems, and to work towards getting (hopefully) an internship position at
    LustLab.
    This meant that starting from the second year of my studies, an increasing number of my projects were realized in
    the medium of code. In order to do this I learned a number of programming languages, starting with <a
        href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>, and web technologies such as HTML/CSS and
    JavaScript.
    Besides conceptualizing and designing projects I also became involved in the creation of my own tools with which to
    produce projects. Programming is not only a tool - like Adobe software - it is a meta-tool: a tool to create other
    tools.
</p>

<p>
    As software proliferates in all areas of life and as it has become our dominant medium of communication it is
    imperative for designers to get familiar with the creative, social, political and technical aspects of it.
    My internship at LustLab offered me unparalleled opportunities to do so. From day one, I was involved in the study,
    use and creation of software tools. LustLab developed their own framework called RNDR, a creative-coding toolkit -
    similar to Processing - written in the programming language
    Java. I used RNDR in most of my LustLab projects for the development of LED installations, interfaces and
    data-visualizations. Besides Java and RNDR, I also learned the ins-and-outs of collaborating on coding projects. I
    learned the use of a source-code management tool called git, which allows programmers to work on the same code-base
    without overwriting each other's changes.
</p>

<p>
    LustLab is also dedicated to social and political dimensions of technologies. They frequently organize workshops for
    students to introduce them to tools and methodologies and to expose them to a critical mindset for the application
    of code within design projects. LustLab is also the co-organizer of the yearly hackathon event <a
        href="http://wthx.org/" target="_blank">WTHX</a> (What The Hacks). The event brings together professionals from
    the worlds of peace, security and justice to formulate questions and prototype solutions for tomorrow's problems.
    Together they try to resolve the problem: if technology is the answer, than what was the question?
</p>

<p>
    Aside from the fact that LustLab consists of a team of professionals developing and applying the latest technologies
    to social, graphic design and interactive media projects, it is also - and maybe more importantly - a tightly knit
    social group that fosters a vibrant studio culture. This aspect of the studio is exemplified by the shared lunches
    every day, the after-lunch ping-pong sessions, the Friday evening hangouts at the nearby pub, De Paas, and the
    subsequent pizza-evenings at the local pizzeria VIP (<span class="strike">Very</span> Vaguely Italian Pizza). It could be said that the people
    of Lust and LustLab are primarily friends and only secondarily colleagues. This is also shown by the fact that even
    though my internship is over, I still frequently hang out with them (whenever I can find a bit of free time in midst
    of the chaotic turmoil of our academy).
</p>
<p>
    All things considered, I look back at my internship at LustLab as one of the most valuable experiences during my
    studies. It is a great place to be for designers that are looking to push the boundaries of their discipline, and to
    become literate in the latest language of design: code.
